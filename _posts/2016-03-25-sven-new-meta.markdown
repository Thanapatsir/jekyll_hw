### FLASH-FARMING (sven new meta)

Sange and Yasha Sange and Yasha, Helm of the Dominator Helm of the Dominator, Blink Dagger Blink Dagger

It is a recent trend to ignore Storm Hammer Storm Hammer past level 1 and concentrate on Great Cleave Great Cleave instead. Even at level 2 this ability surpassess the cleave effect of Battle Fury Battle Fury, disposing neutral camps quicker. Later levels also make clearing out stacked ancients a trivial task. Having extra points in Warcry Warcry helps as well, since under its effect, Sven can negate most of the incoming damage with a lifesteal item.

The game-changer came in the form of Sange and Yasha Sange and Yasha. A big part of flash-farming has always been mobility, since a hero needs to walk from camp to camp to clear them out. S&Y gives exactly that. Coupled with Warcry, Sven Sven can run at a respectable 435 ms, and since the hero doesn’t really need the spell to negate damage against regular neutrals, it is best used to travel between taking out stacks.

Helm of the Dominator Helm of the Dominator is another tool, which allows Sven to eclipse anything on the map in terms of farming speed. If previously it was the support’s job to stack the ancients, the current meta doesn’t necessarily allow for it—to stay relevant, supports should get farm and stay active on the map.

Later on this item can also provide your team with a very strong aura, be it a 30% damage increase from an Alpha Wolf or even a heavily underrated 12% ms bonus from Kobold Foreman. The latter option comes into play far less than it should, since it doesn’t matter how much you hit for if you are unable to get close to the enemy.

Finally, Blink Dagger Blink Dagger will allow for extra mobility during the farming stage as well as open the door for the hero to get involved in the fights and enter the mid-game.
